# FlaskTranslation
This leverages Flask - a Python website framework - to create a database of words from English to French specifically. The goal is for this to be saved in the database to access at any time. This is hosted on a Raspberry Pi in a Python virtual environment, thus the necessary installs will need to be added in a requirements.txt later.
